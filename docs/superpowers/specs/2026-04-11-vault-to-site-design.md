# GURPS Special Forces — Vault-to-Site Generator Design

## Purpose

Publish the GURPS Special Forces Obsidian vault as a mobile-friendly GitHub Pages site. The vault is the single source of truth, maintained by gm-apprentice and Claude. The site is a read-only view that gets regenerated from the vault on demand.

## Workflow

1. Sessions are played, transcripts processed by gm-apprentice, vault updated
2. User tells Claude "update the site from the vault"
3. Claude runs `node build.js` which reads vault markdown, generates static HTML into `docs/`
4. Claude commits and pushes — GitHub Pages serves `docs/` automatically

## Architecture

### Build Pipeline (`build.js`)

A single Node.js script (~200-300 lines) that:

1. Reads `vault.config.json` for vault path and site settings
2. Scans the vault for all `.md` files, skipping: `_meta/`, `_Templates/`, `_resources/`, `.obsidian/`, `.smart-env/`, `node_modules/`
3. Parses each file's YAML frontmatter with `gray-matter`
4. Builds a wiki-link lookup map (entity filename → output URL path)
5. Converts markdown body to HTML with `markdown-it`
6. Resolves `[[wiki-links]]` to relative `<a href>` tags using the lookup map
7. Strips Obsidian-specific blocks (dataview queries, callouts)
8. Selects a template based on frontmatter `type` (character vs wiki vs index)
9. Wraps content in the HTML template with nav, header, footer
10. Writes output to `docs/`
11. Copies `css/style.css` into `docs/css/`
12. Generates index pages for each folder
13. Generates root landing page

### Dependencies

- **`gray-matter`** — YAML frontmatter parsing
- **`markdown-it`** — Markdown to HTML conversion

No frameworks, no bundlers, no build tools beyond Node.js.

### Templates

Five template types, selected by frontmatter `type`:

#### 1. PC Template (`type: pc`)

Interactive mobile-first character sheet with:
- Always-visible header card (name, concept, point total, player)
- Section nav bar for jumping between sections
- Collapsible accordion sections (all collapsed by default except header)
- Scrollable tables for weapon stats, skill lists, equipment
- Expandable cards for skill chains and UW maneuvers
- Monospace font for stat values

Applied to files in `Characters/PCs/`.

#### 2. NPC Template (`type: npc`)

Structured NPC reference page, lighter than a full PC sheet:
- Header card (name, role/occupation, status, nationality)
- Summary section always visible
- Collapsible sections for: Description, Personality, Background, What They Provide / Capabilities, What They Won't Do / Limitations
- Quick stats block (attributes and key skills in a compact table, not full accordion breakdown)
- Contact stats block if the NPC is a Contact (skill, frequency, reliability, cost)
- Relationships rendered from frontmatter
- Stub badge and "Needs Development" box if `canon_status: STUB`

Applied to files in `Characters/NPCs/`. Designed so new NPCs added to the vault render cleanly with minimal structured content — a name, summary, and quick stats are enough for a useful page.

#### 3. Location Template (`type: location`)

Place reference page for campaign locations:
- Header card (name, location type, parent location, atmosphere)
- Summary/description section always visible
- Collapsible sections for: Details, Security, Notable Features, Inhabitants/Occupants
- Frontmatter fields rendered as metadata badges: `location_type`, `security_level`, `atmosphere`
- Parent location linked via `parent_location` frontmatter field (breadcrumb: "The Compound > Main Building > Armoury")
- Relationships rendered from frontmatter (who is `located_at` here, what is `headquartered_at` here)
- Stub badge and "Needs Development" box if `canon_status: STUB`

Applied to files in `Locations/`. No locations exist yet, but the template is ready for when the campaign introduces them.

#### 4. Wiki Template (all other entity types)

Clean prose layout with:
- Maritime colour scheme
- Auto-applied stub badge when `canon_status: STUB`
- Auto-generated "Needs Development" box from `## Needs` sections
- Cross-links between entities via wiki-link resolution
- Responsive readable prose

Applied to: events, factions, organizations, items, documents, clues, campaign overview, timeline.

#### 5. Index Template

Auto-generated directory pages for each folder:
- Cards listing each entity with name, type/role summary, and link
- Sorted alphabetically
- "No entries yet" for empty folders
- Root `index.html` is a landing page with nav grid to all sections

### Content Filtering

- `## Player Notes` sections are **excluded** from all generated pages (player strategy stays in vault only)
- `## Source References` sections are **excluded** (GURPS book page references aren't useful on the web)
- Dataview code blocks are **stripped** (Obsidian-specific, can't render in static HTML)
- `## Appearances` sections with only placeholder text are **excluded**
- `## Relationships` sections with only dataview queries are **replaced** with a rendered list built from frontmatter relationship data

### Wiki-Link Resolution

The build script builds a map of all entity filenames to their output paths:

```
"Ronnie Vint" → "characters/pcs/ronnie-vint.html"
"The Defense Contractor" → "factions/the-defense-contractor.html"
"The Meteor Event" → "events/the-meteor-event.html"
```

`[[Ronnie Vint]]` in any markdown file becomes `<a href="../characters/pcs/ronnie-vint.html">Ronnie Vint</a>` (with correct relative path).

Unresolvable links render as plain text with no broken hrefs.

### Filename Conventions

Vault filenames are slugified for URLs:
- Spaces → hyphens
- Lowercase
- Special characters stripped
- `Dave Crockett.md` → `dave-crockett.html`

### Folder Mapping

| Vault Folder | Output Folder |
|---|---|
| `_Campaign/` | `campaign/` |
| `Characters/PCs/` | `characters/pcs/` |
| `Characters/NPCs/` | `characters/npcs/` |
| `Factions & Organizations/` | `factions/` |
| `Events/` | `events/` |
| `Locations/` | `locations/` |
| `Items & Artifacts/` | `items/` |
| `Documents/` | `documents/` |
| `Clues/` | `clues/` |
| `Chapters/` | `chapters/` |

Empty vault folders still get an index page.

## Design: CSS & Visual

### Colour Scheme (Maritime/Navy)

## GitHub Pages Setup

1. Create repo `AntTheLimey/gurps-special-forces`
2. Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`
3. Site live at `https://antthelimey.github.io/gurps-special-forces`

## Future Improvements

- Automated build via GitHub Actions (push vault changes, site rebuilds)
- Search functionality (client-side lunr.js or similar)
- Relationship graph visualisation
- Session log pages with chapter/session structure
- Auto-diff detection (only rebuild changed pages)
